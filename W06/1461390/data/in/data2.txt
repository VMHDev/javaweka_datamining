Other corpora use a variety of formats for storing part-of-speech tags. NLTK's corpus readers provide a uniform interface so that you don't have to be concerned with the different file formats. In contrast with the file fragment shown above, the corpus reader for the Brown Corpus represents the data as shown below. Note that part-of-speech tags have been converted to uppercase, since this has become standard practice since the Brown Corpus was published.
